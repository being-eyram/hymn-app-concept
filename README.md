## Acknoledgements

A very big thank you to [Kshitij Chauhan](https://twitter.com/haroldadmin?s=20), who wrote a
very inciteful blog on Android **room full text search** used as a reference for my project.
He also extended me a helping when I was faced with a huge bug in the development stages.

And also [Justice Amoh](http://justiceamoh.github.io/) whose database was used in the
development of this project.
